## Detailed Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Install Required Dependencies

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /home/darkhorse/Documents/real-estate-app

# Install Prettier
yarn add -D prettier

# Install Husky for git hooks (optional)
yarn add -D husky

# Verify installation
yarn prettier --version
```

### Step 2: Run Initial Code Formatting

```bash
# Format all files
yarn format

# Or check formatting without making changes
yarn format:check
```

### Step 3: Configure GitHub Secrets

Navigate to: **GitHub Repository â†’ Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions**

Add the following secrets from your `.env` file:

#### Required Secrets:

1. `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - From your Supabase project
2. `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - From your Supabase project
3. `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY` - From your Firebase project
4. `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN` - From your Firebase project
5. `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` - From your Firebase project
6. `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET` - From your Firebase project
7. `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID` - From your Firebase project
8. `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID` - From your Firebase project
9. `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` - From your Google Cloud Console

#### For Deployment:

10. `VERCEL_TOKEN` - From Vercel CLI
11. `VERCEL_ORG_ID` - From Vercel project settings
12. `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` - From Vercel project settings

### Step 4: Set Up Vercel Deployment

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI globally
npm install -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Link project to Vercel
cd /home/darkhorse/Documents/real-estate-app
vercel link

# Get your Vercel token
vercel token

# The Org ID and Project ID will be shown after linking
# Add these to GitHub secrets
```

### Step 5: Enable Branch Protection

1. Go to: **Repository â†’ Settings â†’ Branches**
2. Click "Add rule" or "Add branch protection rule"
3. Set branch name pattern: `main` or `trunk`
4. Enable:
   - âœ… Require status checks to pass before merging
   - âœ… Require branches to be up to date
   - âœ… Lint & Code Quality
   - âœ… TypeScript Type Check
   - âœ… Build Next.js Application
5. Optionally enable:
   - âœ… Require pull request reviews (1 approval recommended)
   - âœ… Dismiss stale reviews when new commits are pushed
6. Click "Create" or "Save changes"

### Step 6: Test the Pipeline

```bash
# Create a new branch
git checkout -b feature/test-ci-pipeline

# Make a small change (e.g., add a comment)
echo "// CI/CD pipeline test" >> app/page.tsx

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "test: verify CI/CD pipeline configuration"
git push origin feature/test-ci-pipeline

# Create pull request on GitHub
# Watch the pipeline run in the Actions tab
```

### Step 7: Add Status Badge to README

Add this to the top of your `README.md`:

```markdown
# Real Estate Management System

![CI/CD Pipeline](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/real-estate-app/workflows/CI%2FCD%20Pipeline/badge.svg)
![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-5.0-blue)
![Next.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/Next.js-15.2-black)
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

## Verification Checklist

### âœ“ Pipeline Functionality

- [ ] Lint job runs successfully
- [ ] TypeCheck job runs successfully
- [ ] Build job completes without errors
- [ ] Build artifacts are uploaded
- [ ] Security audit runs (warnings OK)
- [ ] All jobs show green checkmarks

### âœ“ Pull Request Workflow

- [ ] PR creation triggers pipeline
- [ ] Status checks appear on PR
- [ ] Required checks block merging if failed
- [ ] Merge is possible after all checks pass

### âœ“ Deployment

- [ ] Deployment triggers on main/trunk branch
- [ ] Vercel deployment succeeds
- [ ] Application is accessible at Vercel URL
- [ ] Environment variables are correctly set

### âœ“ Code Quality

- [ ] Prettier formats code correctly
- [ ] ESLint catches common issues
- [ ] TypeScript type checking works
- [ ] All scripts in package.json work

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Prettier not found"

**Solution:**

```bash
yarn add -D prettier
```

### Issue 2: "Permission denied for GitHub Actions"

**Solution:**

- Go to Repository â†’ Settings â†’ Actions â†’ General
- Under "Workflow permissions", select "Read and write permissions"
- Save changes

### Issue 3: "Vercel token invalid"

**Solution:**

```bash
# Generate a new token
vercel token

# Update the VERCEL_TOKEN secret in GitHub
```

### Issue 4: "Build fails due to missing environment variables"

**Solution:**

- Verify all secrets are added to GitHub
- Check secret names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Ensure no typos in the workflow file

### Issue 5: "Yarn cache restore fails"

**Solution:**

- Delete cache in GitHub Actions settings
- Let the pipeline run once to recreate cache
